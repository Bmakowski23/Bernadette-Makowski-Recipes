    <h2><u> "How to Cook a Moose Bone" </u></h2>

    <p> Select the moose leg bone you want to cook. We are going to use the stove to cook our moose bone instead of the campfire.</p>

    <h3><u><em> Instructions </u></em></h3>
      <p> Defrost your moose bone, overnight in the fridge or in the sink. </p>

      <p> Wash any debris off your moose bone. </p>

      <p> <strong>Plain:</strong> wrap your bone with tin foil; place on the pan and throw in the oven at 375 F for 2.5 hours. </p>

      <p> <strong>Flavour:</strong> Use your favourite spices on the moose bone; wrap your bone with tin foil and place onto the plan. Please it in the oven at 375 F for 2.5 hours. </p>

      <p> <em>Suggest spices:</em> My aunt suggested that you can sprinkle a package of Lipton onion package on the bone. You can also use garlic salt or onion salt or pepper on the bone.</p>

      <p> Boil some potatoes before it is cooked. </p>

      <p> Make some fresh oven bannock before it is cooked. </p>

      <p> Take it out the bone when done, and cut it up and enjoy! </p>

      <p> Don't forget to turn off the oven. </p>

      <p> Also, you could eat the bone marrow. Get an axe and chop the bone in half. Grab a long knife or utensil to scrap the bone marrow out of the bone. </p>
    
      <p> Do not eat too much marrow; otherwise, you will be paying the consequences. </p>

 <h4> <em><strong> <u>Elders Tell Us Children </u></em></strong></h4>
  <p> 
When it came to yummy treats from the land like bone marrow, the elders would tell us children that it was not good for us. We only could have a little bit like a finger tip size. They want to save it for themselves because they are older, it is harder on their bodies compare to the children.
